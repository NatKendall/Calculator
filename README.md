# Calculator
Takes input and outputs specific calculations

I wanted to share one of the very first programs I had to create for my Java course. As of now I am leaving the code as is (although I wish to make various adjustments). But I find it useful to have an old file available so that I can look back on this and see how my journey began. 


Details about this program:
- This program will define and initialize two numbers. The user will be asked to enter two numbers which will then go through calculations. The output will show the sum, product, difference of the two numbers.
- It will also calculate the exponent value numberOne ^ numberTwo.
- A sales price with tax rate of 6% will be calculated and displayed.
- Lastly, the program will demonstrate use of the increment and augmented operators.
- Please note that for this program my professor wanted us to show our understanding in variables so you will notice that there are quite a few not being used.
